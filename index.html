  <h1>Response to Louise Druhle's <em><div id="title">Critical Atlas of the Internet</div></em></h1>  
  <div class="container"> </div>

  <div class="quote1"><h2><em>"Internet is a single entity but with a myriad of territorial projections"</em></h2></div>

  <div id ="response1"> Although the internet exists as one standalone concept, its contents have the ability and desire to remove themselves from their source and travel to many other places. </div>

<div class="quote2"><h2><em>"The stroll through the world wide web does not exist anymore"</em></h2></div>

<div id ="response2"> You cannot find yourself freely exploring the internet as you did in the past. Nowadays targeted elements such as ads and suggestions on the internet will influence you. </div>

<div class="quote3"><h2><em>"Internet is a collage of heterogeneous networks. It is a network of networks."</em></h2></div>

<div id ="response3"> The internet is not its own network. it is a platform for outside networks to exist on and interact with one another, creating its own network. </div>

<div class="response">In creating fifteen hypotheses that examine questions surrounding the spatial aspect of the internet, Drulhe highlights how its form and physical characteristics are interconnected with sociopolitical factors on both individual and greater levels. <br>

      The internet can be visualized in various different ways as Drulhe showed; many of these forms emphasize where concentrations of power lie as well as the users that play into the collection of this power (sites such as amazon, google, and facebook obviously have the most users, so a visual framework of the internet according to activity would acknowledge their existence). <br> 
    
    The internet can also be visualized in its jurisdictions and outside influence / how it is run. Because the U.S. determines a lot of these aspects, it holds the most power in affecting the operations of the internet. A visualization of the internet based on it's upkeep and concentration would note the U.S. as a big player, for example. <br>
